In today's IT414 lab, all students must implement the FP-Tree algorithm on the following datasets with the given specifications :
Dataset 1- All Electronics:

In the given example dataset I1,I2,I3, etc are the items

Generate all the Frequent Item sets with the minimum support of 2

Generate all the Association Rule with a confidence threshold >=70%, and with frequent 3 item set (Length 3)

Dataset 2- Goods dataset (Consider the First 100 data):

In the given example dataset 30, 31, 32,33 etc are the items

Generate all the Frequent Item sets with the minimum support of 3

Generate all the Association Rule with a confidence threshold >=70%, and with frequent 4 item set (Length 8)
