# NITK23-IT-Lab

This repository conains all IT lab assignments(and maybe projects) which I received/did during my BTech IT in NITK Surathkal 2019-23.

Some assignments were divided into batches depending on our roll number. I've included the questions given across all batches but the program is the one which is of only my batch. Other batch members are welcome to open a PR with their programs.

My roll number is **191427191IT234**.
